After that we are ahere to meet perfect place to good candidates. Some web sites are simply search engines that collect results from multiple independent job boards. This is an example of both metasearch (since these are search engines which search other search engines) and vertical search (since the searches are limited to a specific topic - job listings).<br />
<br />
Some of these new search engines primarily index traditional job boards. These sites aim to provide a &quot;one-stop shop&quot; for job-seekers who don&#39;t need to search the underlying job boards. In 2006, tensions developed between the job boards and several scraper sites, with Craigslist banning scrapers from its job classifieds and Monster.com specifically banning scrapers through its adoption of a robots exclusion standard on all its pages while others have embraced them.<br />
<br />
Indeed.com, a &quot;job aggregator&quot;, collects job postings from employer websites, job boards, online classifieds, and association websites. Simply Hired is another large aggregator collecting job postings from many sources.<br />

COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
<br />
<b>What are cookies?</b>
<br />
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device.
<br />
Cookies do many different jobs, such as letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. They can also help to ensure that the advertisements and other content you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. They can be set by the website that you are visiting (known as first party cookies) or by another entity such as an advertising network (known as third party cookies).The cookies used on this website have been categorized on the basis of the four categories found in the ICC UK Cookie guide. Session cookies are temporary and once you close the browser window they are deleted from your device. Persistent cookies remain on your device for a longer period and are used by the website to recognize your device when you return.
<br />
What other tracking technology do we use?
<br />
We may also use web beacons or other technologies for similar purposes and we may include these in marketing e-mail messages to determine whether messages have been opened and links clicked on. Web beacons do not place information on your device, but may work in conjunction with cookies to monitor website activity.
<br />
What if I don’t want cookies?
<br />
By using our website you agree that we can place cookies and other similar technologies on your device as explained below. If you want to remove existing cookies from your device you can do this using your browser options. If you want to block future cookies being placed on your device you can change your browser settings to do this. When you review your browser settings or options, you can identify the HRMS System cookies by the fact they include “.HRMS System” in the name. For more information on managing cookies see www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies.
<br />
Please bear in mind that deleting and blocking cookies will have an impact on your user experience as parts of the website may no longer work. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings to block cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our website or click a link in a targeted email we have sent you, even if you have previously deleted our cookies.
<br />
You cannot remove or block web beacons or personalized URLs, as they form part of the content of web pages and emails rather than placing information on your device. But, as they work in conjunction with cookies, turning off cookies will also prevent any web beacons from tracking your user activity on our site. The web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but your unique information will not be recorded.
<br />
What types of cookies are there and which ones does this website use?
<br />
Strictly necessary cookies – These cookies are essential to enable you to move around the site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided.

These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how a website works.
<br />

Once you close your browser, our session management cookies are deleted.
<br />
Functionality cookies – These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local information or news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. They don’t gather any information about you that could be used for advertising or remembering where you’ve been on the internet outside our website.
<br />

<br />

<br />

They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often they will be linked to website functionality provided by the other organization.
<br />
At HRMS System we do not have third party advertising on our website but these cookies may be used on third party websites and third parties may use them on our website as follows:
<br />
Third party social media websites may log information about you, for example if you click an “Add This” or “Like” button for a social media website while on our website. We do not control such websites or their activities. You may be able to find information about social media websites on the websites themselves. We recommend you read the terms of use and privacy policy of such websites before using them.
<br />
If you click on a HRMS System advertisement on a non-HRMS System website, a cookie may be used to log which website you are on, to ensure our advertisements are served effectively and to measure whether our advertisements are viewed.
<br />
We use reputable third parties to gather and provide us with information about our website and advertising audiences and to deliver targeted advertisements on third party sites. These third parties only use anonymous identifiers and have no way of associating these identifiers with identifiable users.
<br />
Use of cookies for marketing and analytics – We may use information collected from our cookies to identify user behavior and to serve content and offers based on your profile, and for the other purposes described below.
<br />

<br />
If we send you a targeted email which includes web beacons, cookies or similar technologies we will know whether you open, read, or delete the message.
<br />
When you click a link in a marketing e-mail you receive from HRMS System, we will also use a cookie to log what pages you view and what content you download from our websites, even if you are not registered at or signed into our site.
<br />
Non-cookie tracking technologies – HRMS System also employs technologies that perform similar functions to cookies, but that may not respond to browser settings intended for use with cookies. These include personalized URLs (PURLs), web beacons, and other similar technologies.
<br />
<b>MARKETING</b>
<br />
HRMS System uses personal data of our clients, potential recruits, alumni and other business contacts to develop and strengthen our client, employee and business relationships, provide information about our company and services and to communicate about our services. In general, HRMS System is a business-to-business company, and does not typically market to consumers or the general public (other than to potential recruits and alumni). Rather, our marketing activities are targeted to relevant individuals we identify as decision makers at current or potential client companies. The bulk of the personal data we collect and use for marketing purposes relates to individual employees of our clients and other companies with which we have an existing business relationship. We may also obtain contact information from public sources, including content made public at social media websites, to make an initial contact with a relevant individual at a client or other company.
<br />
Targeted E-mail. We send commercial e-mail to individuals at our client or other companies with whom we want to develop or maintain a business relationship. Our targeted e-mail messages typically include web beacons, cookies, and similar technologies that allow us to know whether you open, read, or delete the message, and links you may click. When you click a link in a marketing e-mail you receive from HRMS System, we will also use a cookie to log what pages you view and what content you download from our websites, even if you are not registered at or signed into our site.
<br />
Targeted e-mails from HRMS System may include additional data privacy information, as required by applicable laws.
<br />
HRMS System may opt to use customer relationship management (CRM) database technology to manage and track our marketing efforts. Such databases include personal data belonging to individuals at our client and other companies with whom we already have a business relationship or want to develop one. The personal data used for these purposes includes relevant business information, such as: contact data, publicly available information (e.g. board membership, published articles, press releases, your public posts on social media sites if relevant for business purpose), your responses to targeted e-mail (including web activity following links from our e-mails), website activity of registered users of our website, and other business information included by HRMS System professionals based on their personal interactions with you. If you wish to be excluded from our CRM databases, please use the contact us form.
<br />
We may combine data from publicly available sources, and from our e-mail, website, and personal interactions with you. We combine this data to better understand your needs and the needs of your company, to assess the suitability of our service offerings for your needs, and to perform the other activities described throughout this privacy statement.
<br />
<b>RECRUITING</b>
<br />
If you use HRMS System’s online career resources, we collect personal data that you submit to the website and use it for recruiting-related purposes. We may also use Cookies and other tracking technology and the same technologies we use for Marketing (including Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Databases, Targeted E-mail & Combining and Analyzing Personal Data) to provide individuals with a personalized online experience, to send relevant information about careers and opportunities at HRMS System, and to analyze the effectiveness of our recruitment efforts and resources.
